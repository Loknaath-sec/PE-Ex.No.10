4. **Generating and Refining Outputs**
   - Use ChatGPT to produce drafts.
   - Refine outputs iteratively using more detailed and structured prompts.  
   - Evaluate for structure, professionalism, and insight.

5. **Evaluation Criteria**
   Each output is assessed for:
   - **Clarity and Structure** – Logical organization and flow.
